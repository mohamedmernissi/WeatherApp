# WeatherApp

This is a weather app that allows users to see cities' forcast. The user can add, delete and search cities in the app. The data is retrieved from www.worldweatheronline.com.

For this project i used the VIPER architecture, with 2 modules :

- Cities Module that contains the logic of fetching data from the api and storing it in a model.

- Weather details module that shows the weather details of all the cities.
